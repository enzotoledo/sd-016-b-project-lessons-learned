     ssuuddoo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.  The invoking user's real (_n_o_t
     effective) user-ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy.

     ssuuddoo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging
     plugins to work seamlessly with the ssuuddoo front end.  The default security policy is _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, which is configured via the file _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s, or via LDAP.  See
     the _P_l_u_g_i_n_s section for more information.

     The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run ssuuddoo.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or
     another authentication mechanism.  If authentication is required, ssuuddoo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit.  This
     limit is policy-specific; the default password prompt timeout for the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s security policy is 0 minutes.

     Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to run ssuuddoo again for a period of time without requiring authentication.  By default, the
     _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy caches credentials on a per-terminal basis for 15 minutes.  See the _t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p___t_y_p_e and _t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p___t_i_m_e_o_u_t options in sudoers(5) for more infor‐
     mation.  By running ssuuddoo with the --vv option, a user can update the cached credentials without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

     When invoked as ssuuddooeeddiitt, the --ee option (described below), is implied.

     Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use ssuuddoo.  If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may be logged as
     well.

     The options are as follows:

     --AA, ----aasskkppaassss
                 Normally, if ssuuddoo requires a password, it will read it from the user's terminal.  If the --AA (_a_s_k_p_a_s_s) option is specified, a (possibly graphical)
                 helper program is executed to read the user's password and output the password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable
                 is set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise, if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the askpass program, that value will
                 be used.  For example:

                     # Path to askpass helper program
                     Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

                 If no askpass program is available, ssuuddoo will exit wit
